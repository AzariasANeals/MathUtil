You run this project by going into the Main class and 
calling the MathUtils class. The class has 4 static methods, add, subtract, multiply
and divide. To run it simply input 2 integers (x and y) and it will add (x+y), 
subtract (x-y), multiply (x*y) and divide (x/y). The divide method will return a 
Double NaN if you input y = 0.
